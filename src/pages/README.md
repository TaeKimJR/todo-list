# Pages

Pages define the top-level component for a top-level route. 

You can find the top-level routes in `src/App.tsx`. Every top-level route should be mapped to a Page component in the `src/pages` directory.

The logic within Pages should be minimal. Instead, opt to create "Features" that encapsulate logic and use those in Pages.
